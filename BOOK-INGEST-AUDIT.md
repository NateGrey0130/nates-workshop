# Book-ingestion batch — deferred code changes, 2026-08-28

Findings menu for the seven-book ingestion batch registered in
`BOOK-INGEST-QUEUE.md`. **This file holds code changes only.** Data — classes,
skills, spells, psionics, gear, `scripts/books.json` entries, class markdown —
ships with its own book, as it always has; nothing waits here for that.

A finding lands here when a book needs a mechanic the app cannot express, or
when the ingestion loop turns up a defect in the tooling rather than in the
data. The rule for the batch is: **import what the schema supports, record what
was dropped in the row's `extraction_notes`, file the gap here, keep going.**
Do not stop to implement.

Protocol is the usual one — see the `audit-menu` skill. Numbered `F1..Fn`,
`###` headings, one PR per finding, taken only when Nate names one, dated
outcome note appended under the finding in the same PR, merged on a separate
word. A finding is **audited when it is taken**: verify its premises against
current code before scoping, and lead with the corrections.

**One menu for the whole batch, not one per book.** The same missing mechanic
will turn up in more than one of these seven; add the new book's rows to the
existing finding rather than opening a second number for it.

## Findings

### F1 — A numeric column is never checked against the page it cites

`source-coverage.mjs` answers *is the cited page one this machine holds*. It
says so itself: **traceable means checkable, not correct.** Nothing anywhere
asks the next question — *is this number printed on that page* — for any
numeric or free-text column, and the columns that most need it are exactly the
ones no test touches:

| column | checked by | what has gone wrong |
|---|---|---|
| `imported_classes` `starting_money` | nothing | two wrong figures shipped in the ju batch (PR #280) |
| `skills.note` | nothing | the ju/RUE Gambling variance recorded on the wrong skill, with the wrong number (fixed 2026-08-28) |
| `gear.cost` / `gear.mdc` | nothing | none found, but 42 ju rows were only confirmed by an ad-hoc script written for this session and then thrown away |

The ad-hoc script is the point. Verifying the ju gear took ~30 lines: parse the
`p.N-M` suffix off `source_book`, apply the book's offset, and ask whether the
stored number appears in the cached text, in bare and comma-grouped form. It
found 3 of 42 rows "missing", and all three were prices the book states in words
(*"3.6 million credits"*) — a **7% false-positive rate on a first attempt**,
which is the reason this has to be advisory rather than a gate.

**Proposal:** add a `--values` pass to `scripts/source-coverage.mjs` that, for
every row whose `source_book` carries a page range, tests each numeric column's
value for presence in the cited pages of the cache, in bare and comma-grouped
form, and reports the misses as a named list. **Posture: advisory, log-only, no
new exit code and no gate** — a miss is a row worth reading by eye, never a
failure. The false-positive rate above is why; a book that prices in words would
fail a gate on every such row. Report the miss rate alongside the misses so the
number stays visible.

Worth deciding when taken, not before: whether the same pass covers
`skills.base` / `per_level`, where a bare `30` appears on almost any page and
the check would be nearly all noise. The gear columns are the ones with the
signal.

**Open.**
